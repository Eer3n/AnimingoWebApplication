        <p>  Obi Wan has been with me since he was a kitten. He is a social cat and very playful. Because of CoV-19, I stayed at home for a long time, and Obi got used to my presence.
             However, now I go to the office, and he got so depressed from my sudden going outs.
             Plus, I was also struggling with socializing. However, since I started to use this app, now he has Cat friends, and I met with other cat owners,
             Obi and I made new friends! This app is the BESTTTTTTT xp...
